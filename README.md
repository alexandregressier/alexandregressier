### What you will find here

Most of my GitHub repositories gather the various experiments I conduct while reading technical books or video
courses. Hopefully, you will find a valuable piece of code you were looking for.

### How to reach me

Your best bet is to direct message me on Twitter [@_gressier](https://twitter.com/_gressier), but a
little [email](mailto:hello@gressier.dev) works just as well.
