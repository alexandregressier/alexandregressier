## A little bit about myself

### What my interests in computing consist of

- Back end as much as Front end development (web & mobile)
- Kotlin & the JVM ecosystem
- Functional Programming (via Scala & Kotlin)
- The Gradle build tool
- The Microservice architecture (via Spring & Kubernetes)
- Cloud native & Serverless computing (via AWS)
- Native Android & iOS development
- Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)
- Declarative User Interfaces (via Jetpack Compose & SwiftUI)
- React with Redux, the whole written in TypeScript
- Designing & animating with CSS
- 3D computer graphics & Illustrations (via Cinema 4D & Illustrator)
- Leveraging Vim & Emacs keybindings in IntelliJ IDEA

### What you will find here

Most of my GitHub repositories gather the various experiments I conduct while reading technological books or video
courses. Hopefully, you will find the valuable piece of code you were looking for.

### Get me to contribute to your project

If you are programming anything directly or indirectly related to Kotlin, I am confident that the time spent listening
to you will be worthwhile. I am genuinely eager to collaborate on anything relevant to my interests above. Feel free to
contact me.

### How to reach me

Your best bet is to direct message me on Twitter [@_gressier](https://twitter.com/_gressier), but a
little [email](mailto:hello@gressier.dev) works just as well.
